# Mandelbrot-gtk-0.3.1
Mandelbrot-gtk is a code which puts the mathematical equation of the Mandelbrot set into graphical form, creating fractals within the program.

This edited version of the Mandelbrot set has been modified by adding the feature for drag and drop zooming, to allow for more precise
and more user controlled zooming.
